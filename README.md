# Quake 1 binary logic

This is the source code behind my "Minecraft-style logic in Quake" video: 

[![Minecraft-style logic in Quake](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xVLtnKyRSb4/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVLtnKyRSb4)

This repository is a Python application that generates Quake map sources for the adder shown in the video.  Install with `pip install -e .`.  The map can be generated by by running `q1logic_create_map`, and built with [ericw-tools](http://ericwa.github.io/ericw-tools/).  The resulting bsp file can be opened in a modern source port that supports increased limits.  In the video I use [vkQuake](https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake) since it is capable of rendering the relatively large scene at a high frame rate.

The [entry-point is in map.py](../../blob/master/q1logic/map.py#L409), which is probably the best place to start exploring
the source code.
